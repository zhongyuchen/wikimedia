He ruled in Lithuania from 1377. Born a [[Lithuanian paganism|pagan]], in 1386 he converted to Catholicism and was baptized as Władysław in [[Kraków]], married the young Queen Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło.&lt;ref name=&quot;bojtár&quot;/&gt; In 1387 he [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted Lithuania]] to Christianity. His own reign in Poland started in 1399, upon the death of Queen Jadwiga, and lasted a further thirty-five years and laid the foundation for the centuries-long [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]. He was a member of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in Poland that bears his name and was previously also known as the [[Gediminids|Gediminid dynasty]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The dynasty ruled both states until 1572,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;[[Anna Jagiellon]], the last member of royal Jagiellon family, died in 1596.&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the most influential dynasties in late [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bojtar&quot;/&gt; During his reign, the Polish-Lithuanian state was the largest state in the [[Christian world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocz&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nJogaila was the last [[pagan]] ruler of [[medieval Lithuania]]. After he became King of Poland, as a result of the [[Union of Krewo]], the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian union confronted the growing power of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. The allied victory at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, followed by the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|Peace of Thorn]], secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish–Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of Władysław II Jagiełło extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland\\'s [[Polish Golden Age|Golden Age]].

Previously historians assumed he was born in 1352, but some recent research suggests a later date—about 1362.&lt;ref name=&quot;tęgowski&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tęgowski|1999|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was the son of [[Algirdas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, [[Uliana of Tver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potašenko|2008|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nThe Grand Duchy of Lithuania to which Jogaila succeeded as Grand Duke in 1377 was a political entity composed of two leading, but very different nationalities and two political systems: ethnic Lithuania in the north-west and the vast [[Ruthenia]]n territories of former [[Kievan Rus\\']], comprising the lands of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of western Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;stone&quot;/&gt; At first, Jogaila—like his father—based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania, while his uncle, [[Kęstutis]], the [[Duke of Trakai]], continued to rule the north-western region.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some historians have called this system a diarchy ({{Harvnb|Sruogienė-Sruoga|1987}}; {{Harvnb|Deveike|1950}}). However, Rowell suggests that the nature of this dual rule &quot;...reflects political expediency; it certainly does not meet the formal definition of diarchy as \\'rule by two independent authorities\\'...those two leaders were not equal: the grand duke in Vilnius was supreme&quot; ({{Harvnb|Rowell|1994|p=68}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Jogaila\\'s succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bojtar&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n[[File:Jagajła. Ягайла (M. Godlewski, 1863).jpg|thumb|Modern depiction of Władysław II Jagiełło]]\\n\\nAt the start of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus\\' lands. In 1377–78, [[Andrei of Polotsk]], the eldest son of Algirdas, challenged Jogaila\\'s authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, [[Demetrius I Starshy|Dmitry]], sided with Prince [[Dmitri Donskoi|Dmitri of Moscow]] against Jogaila\\'s alliance with emir [[Mamai]], de facto khan of the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;plokhy&quot;/&gt; Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering in the vicinity of the battlefield, which led to Mamai\\'s army\\'s significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. The Muscovites\\' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis.\\n\\nIn the north-west, Lithuania faced constant armed incursions from the [[Teutonic Knights]]—founded after 1226 to fight and convert the pagan [[Baltic tribes]] of [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Lithuanians]]. In 1380, Jogaila concluded the secret [[Treaty of Dovydiškės]], directed against Kęstutis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bojtar&quot;/&gt; When Kęstutis discovered the plan, the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384)|Lithuanian Civil War]] began. He seized Vilnius, overthrew Jogaila, and pronounced himself grand duke in his place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt; In 1382, Jogaila raised an army from his father\\'s vassals and confronted Kęstutis near Trakai. Kęstutis and his son [[Vytautas]] entered Jogaila\\'s encampment for negotiations but were tricked and imprisoned in the [[Kreva Castle]], where Kęstutis was found dead, probably murdered, a week later.&lt;ref name=&quot;bojtár1&quot;/&gt; Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of [[Ordensburg Marienburg|Marienburg]] and was baptised there under the name Wigand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nJogaila formulated the [[Treaty of Dubysa]], which rewarded the Knights for their aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them [[Samogitia]] west of the [[Dubysa]] river. However, when Jogaila failed to ratify the treaty, the Knights invaded Lithuania in the summer of 1383. In 1384, Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai. Vytautas then turned against the Knights, attacking and looting several Prussian castles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mick&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Baptism and marriage===\\n{{see also|Jadwiga of Poland}}\\n\\nJogaila\\'s Russian mother [[Uliana of Tver]] urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of [[Dmitri Donskoi|Prince Dmitri of Moscow]], who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The historian [[John Meyendorff]] suggests Jogaila may have already been an Orthodox Christian: &quot;In 1377, Olgerd of Lithuania died, leaving the Grand Principality to his son Jagiello, an Orthodox Christian...&quot; ({{harvnb|Meyendorff|1989|p=205}}). Dmitri, however, made it a condition of the marriage that Jogaila &quot;should be baptized in the Orthodox faith and that he should proclaim his Christianity to all men&quot; ({{harvnb|Dvornik|1992|p=221}}).&lt;/ref&gt; That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights, who regarded [[Orthodox Christians]] as schismatics and little better than heathens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bojtar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt; Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a [[Catholic]] and marry the eleven-year-old Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Jadwiga had actually been crowned [[king of Poland]] (\\'\\'rex poloni\\'\\'), because the Polish political system made no provision for a [[queen regnant]] {{harvnb|Stone|2001|p=8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The nobles of [[Lesser Poland]] made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. They wanted to neutralize the dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of [[Galicia–Volhynia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lukowski&quot;/&gt; The Polish nobles saw the offer as an opportunity for increasing their privileges&lt;ref name=&quot;dvornik&quot;/&gt; and avoiding Austrian influence, brought by Jadwiga\\'s previous fiancé [[William, Duke of Austria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lukowski2&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nOn 14 August 1385 in [[Kreva Castle]], Jogaila confirmed his prenuptial promises in the [[Union of Krewo]] (Union of Kreva). The promises included the adoption of Christianity, repatriation of lands &quot;stolen&quot; from Poland by its neighbours, and \\'\\'terras suas Lithuaniae et Russiae Coronae Regni Poloniae perpetuo applicare\\'\\', a clause interpreted by historians to mean anything from a [[personal union]] between Lithuania and Poland to a complete incorporation of Lithuania into Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;lukowski3&quot;/&gt; The agreement at Kreva has been described both as far-sighted and as a desperate gamble.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It &quot;reflects the exceptional far-sightedness of the political elites ruling both countries&quot; ({{Harvnb|Kłoczowski|2000|p=55}}). It was &quot;a desperate gamble by Jogaila to avert a seemingly inevitable subjugation&quot; ({{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2001|p=38}})&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nJogaila was duly baptised at the [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Kraków]] on 15 February 1386 and from then on formally used the name Władysław or Latin versions of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;sruogien&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A Slavic name that roughly translates as \\'\\'glorious rule\\'\\', Władysław is often [[Latinization (literature)|Latinised]] into either Wladislaus or Ladislaus. The choice evoked both [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I of Poland, the Elbow-high]], who was Queen Jadwiga\\'s great-grandfather and unified the kingdom in 1320, and Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], a king who sided with the pope against the emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and Christianised [[Transylvania]] ({{harvnb|Rowell|2000|pp=709–712}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage took place three days later, and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King Władysław by archbishop [[Bodzanta]]. He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga\\'s mother, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga\\'s death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt; The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila\\'s court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kłoczowski&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kłoczowski|2000|pp=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; a beginning of the final [[Christianization of Lithuania]]. Though the ethnic [[Lithuanian nobility]] were the main converts to Catholicism—both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants—the king\\'s conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kłoczowski&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n==Ruler of Lithuania and Poland==\\n\\n===Accession===\\n[[File:Polska 1386 - 1434.png|250px|thumb|Poland and Lithuania 1386–1434]]\\n\\nWładysław II Jagiello and Queen Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs; and though Jadwiga probably had little real power, she took an active part in Poland\\'s political and cultural life. In 1387, she led two successful military expeditions to [[Red Ruthenia]], recovered lands her father [[Louis I of Hungary]] had transferred from Poland to Hungary, and secured the homage of [[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I, Voivode of Moldavia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica&quot;/&gt; In 1390, she also personally opened negotiations with the Teutonic Order. Most political responsibilities, however, fell to Jagiello, with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nSoon after Jagiello\\'s accession to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted [[Vilnius]] a city charter like that of [[Kraków]], modeled on the [[Magdeburg Law]]; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of [[Trakai]] on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of [[Bolesław the Pious|Boleslaus the Pious]] and [[Casimir the Great]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-legal&quot;/&gt; Władysław\\'s policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica&quot;/&gt; By the time of the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvornik4&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nOne effect of Jagiello\\'s measures was to be the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars.&lt;ref name=&quot;magocsi&quot;/&gt; As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus\\' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;plokhy-98&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Challenges===\\n[[File:Vytautas the great.jpg|thumb|[[Vytautas the Great]]]]\\nJagiello\\'s baptism failed to end the [[crusade]] of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his conversion was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that [[pagan]]s remained in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Housley&quot;/&gt; From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain the cause of a crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedlar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turnbull&quot;/&gt; Władysław sponsored the creation of the [[Archdiocese of Vilnius|diocese of Vilnius]] under [[bishop of Vilnius|bishop]] [[Andrzej Wasilko]], the former confessor of [[Elisabeth of Hungary]]. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of [[Gniezno]] and not to that of Teutonic [[Königsberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt; The decision may not have improved Władysław\\'s relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kłoczowski&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nIn 1389, Władysław\\'s rule in Lithuania faced a revived challenge from Vytautas, who resented the power given to [[Skirgaila]] in Lithuania at the expense of his own patrimony.&lt;ref name=Mick/&gt; Vytautas started a [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392)|civil war in Lithuania]], aiming to become the Grand Duke. On 4 September 1390, the joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Grand Master, [[Konrad von Wallenrode]], laid siege to Vilnius, which was held by Władysław\\'s regent Skirgaila with combined Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bojtar&quot;/&gt; Although the Knights lifted the siege of the castle after a month, they reduced much of the outer city to ruins. This bloody conflict was eventually brought to a temporary halt in 1392 with the [[Treaty of Ostrów]], by which Władysław handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace: Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as the Grand Duke (\\'\\'magnus dux\\'\\') until his death, under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke (\\'\\'dux supremus\\'\\') in the person of the Polish monarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell&quot;/&gt; Skirgaila was moved from the [[Duchy of Trakai]] to become prince of Kiev.&lt;ref name=&quot;stone5&quot;/&gt; Vytautas initially accepted his status but soon began to pursue Lithuania\\'s independence from Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dvornik&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe protracted period of war between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the [[Treaty of Salynas]], named after the islet in the [[Neman River]] where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize [[Pskov]], while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize [[Novgorod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica&quot;/&gt; Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan [[Tokhtamysh]] of the [[White Horde]], were crushed by the [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurids]] at the [[Battle of the Vorskla River]], ending his imperial ambitions in the east and obliging him to submit to Władysław\\'s protection once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bojtar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dvornik&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n==King of Poland==\\n\\n===Early actions===\\n&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:100zl r.jpg|thumb|300px|100-[[Polish złoty|złoty]] banknote featuring Władysław II Jagiełło]] --&gt;\\n\\nOn 22 June 1399, Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter, baptised [[Elizabeth Bonifacia of Poland|Elizabeth Bonifacia]], but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga\\'s death undermined Władysław\\'s right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of [[Lesser Poland]], generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of [[Greater Poland]] began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying [[Anna of Celje]], a granddaughter of [[Casimir III of Poland]], a political match that re-legitimised his reign.\\n\\nThe [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]] of 1401 confirmed the status of Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław\\'s overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian [[boyar]]s were to elect a new monarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-103&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stone-11&quot;/&gt; Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, the implications of the union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent [[defensive alliance]] between the two states, strengthening Lithuania\\'s hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedlar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dvornik&quot;/&gt; While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nIn late 1401, the new war against the Order overstretched the resources of the Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław\\'s brothers, the malcontent [[Švitrigaila]], chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Housley&quot;/&gt; On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in [[Malbork|Marienburg]], where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-103&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Against the Teutonic Order===\\n[[File:Pieczęć Jagiełły.jpg|thumb|200px|Royal seal of Władysław II Jagiełło]]\\n\\nThe war ended in the [[Treaty of Raciąż]] on 22 May 1404. Władysław acceded to the formal cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order\\'s designs on [[Pskov]]; in return, [[Konrad von Jungingen]] undertook to sell Poland the disputed [[Dobrzyń Land]] and the town of [[Złotoryja]], once pawned to the Order by [[Władysław Opolski]], and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on [[Novgorod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-103&quot;/&gt; Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in [[Silesia]].\\n\\nAlso in 1404, Władysław held talks at [[Wrocław|Vratislav]] with [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]], who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław supported him in his power struggle within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt; Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Śląsk&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic war===\\n{{Main|Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War|Battle of Grunwald}}\\n[[File:Matejko Battle of Grunwald.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Battle of Grunwald]], 1410. Painting by Jan Matejko]]\\nIn December 1408, Władysław and Vytautas held strategic talks in [[Navahrudak Castle]], where they decided to foment a [[Samogitian uprising]] against Teutonic rule to draw German forces away from [[Pomerelia]]. Władysław promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;karwasińska&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karwasińska|Zakrzewski|1935|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising, which began in May 1409, at first provoked little reaction from the Knights, who had not yet consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying Władysław\\'s court at [[Oborniki]], warning his nobles against Polish involvement in a war between Lithuania and the Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-106&quot;/&gt; Władysław, however, bypassed his nobles and informed new Grand Master [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia, Poland would intervene. This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on 6 August, which Władysław received on 14 August in [[Nowy Korczyn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-106&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe castles guarding the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą|Dobrzyń]] and [[Bobrowniki]], the capital of Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into [[Bydgoszcz]] (German: Bromberg). Władysław arrived on the scene in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at [[Płock]] in [[Masovia]] and had a [[pontoon bridge]] constructed and transported north down the [[Vistula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;turnbull6&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nMeanwhile, both sides unleashed diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched letters to the monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens;&lt;ref name=&quot;delbrück&quot;/&gt; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-108&quot;/&gt; Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslas IV of Bohemia]] signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]], allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-110&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Battle of Grunwald===\\n{{Main|Battle of Grunwald}}\\n[[File:Panorama of Malbork Castle, part 4.jpg|thumb|right|The Teutonic Order\\'s castle at Marienburg]]\\n\\nWhen the war resumed in June 1410, Władysław advanced into the Teutonic heartland at the head of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at [[Czerwińsk]], his troops met up with those of [[Vytautas]], whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and [[Tatars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone 2001 16&quot;/&gt; The Teutonic Order\\'s army numbered about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans, and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] after one of the largest and most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=&quot;bojtár7&quot;/&gt; the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order\\'s army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master [[Ulrich von Jungingen]] and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone 2001 16&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe road to the Teutonic capital [[Malbork|Marienburg]] now lay open, the city undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;turnbull8&quot;/&gt; On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, arriving at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, [[Heinrich von Plauen]], had organised a defence of the fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone-17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turnbull9&quot;/&gt; The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications,&lt;ref name=Stone-17/&gt; to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, to Władysław\\'s unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated as to not upset the balance of power between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasienica2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jasienica2&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Dissent===\\n[[File:Polish and Lithuanian Conflict with Prussia. 1377-1435..png|thumb|right|Polish and Lithuanian conflict with Teutonic Prussia, 1377–1434.]]\\n\\nThe war ended in 1411 with the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|Peace of Thorn]], in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home their negotiating advantage to the full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobles. Poland regained [[Dobrzyń Land]], Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the [[Wkra]] river. Most of the Teutonic Order\\'s territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. Władysław then proceeded to release many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order\\'s resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge10&quot;/&gt; This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles\\' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław\\'s regime after 1411, further fuelled by the granting of [[Podolia]], disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king\\'s two-year absence in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-121&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nIn an effort to outflank his critics, Władysław promoted the leader of the opposing faction, bishop [[Mikołaj Trąba]], to the archbishopric of [[Gniezno]] in autumn 1411 and replaced him in Kraków with [[Wojciech Jastrzębiec]], a supporter of Vytautas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-121&quot;/&gt; He also sought to create more allies in Lithuania. In the [[Union of Horodło]], signed on 2 October 1413, he decreed that the status of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was &quot;tied to our Kingdom of Poland permanently and irreversibly&quot; and granted the Catholic nobles of Lithuania privileges equal to those of the Polish [[szlachta]]. The act included a clause prohibiting the Polish nobles from electing a monarch without the consent of the Lithuanian nobles, and the Lithuanian nobles from electing a grand duke without the consent of the Polish monarch.&lt;ref name=stone-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dvornik11&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n===Last conflicts===\\nIn 1414, a sporadic new war broke out, known as the &quot;[[Hunger War]]&quot; from the Knights\\' [[scorched earth|scorched-earth]] tactics of burning fields and mills; but both the Knights and the Lithuanians were too exhausted from the previous war to risk a major battle, and the fighting petered out in the autumn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-121&quot;/&gt; Hostilities did not flare up again until 1419, during the [[Council of Constance]], when they were called off at the papal legate\\'s insistence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-121&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe Council of Constance proved a turning point in the Teutonic crusades, as it did for several European conflicts. Vytautas sent a delegation in 1415, including the [[metropolitan of Kiev]] and Samogitian witnesses; they arrived at Constance at the end of that year to express their preference for being &quot;baptised with water and not with blood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;housley&quot;/&gt; The Polish envoys, among them [[Mikołaj Trąba]], [[Zawisza Czarny]], and [[Paweł Włodkowic]], lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order\\'s aggression against Lithuania and Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;kłoczowski&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kłoczowski|2000|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the Polish–Lithuanian diplomacy, the council, though scandalised by Włodkowic\\'s questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state, denied the Order\\'s request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland–Lithuania.&lt;ref name=&quot;housley12&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe diplomatic context at Constance included the revolt of the Bohemian [[Hussite]]s, who looked upon Poland as an ally in their wars against [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the [[Four Articles of Prague]], which he was not prepared to do. After Władysław\\'s refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław\\'s nephew, [[Sigismund Korybut]], attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success.&lt;ref name=&quot;bideleux&quot;/&gt; Vytautas accepted Sigismund\\'s offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław\\'s blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.&lt;ref name=stone-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge13&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n[[File:Grobowiec krolowej Jadwigi.jpg|thumb|Jadwiga\\'s sarcophagus, [[Wawel Cathedral]]]]\\n\\nIn 1422, Władysław fought another war, known as the [[Gollub War]], against the Teutonic Order, defeating them in under two months before the Order\\'s imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting [[Treaty of Melno]] ended the Knights\\' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania. Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of [[Palanga]], but the city of [[Klaipėda]] was left to the Order.&lt;ref name=stone-11/&gt; This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years, until 1920. The terms of this treaty have, however, been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat, as a result of Władysław\\'s renunciation of Polish claims to Pomerania, Pomerelia, and [[Chełmno Land]], for which he received only the town of [[Nieszawa]] in return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jasienica-130&quot;/&gt; The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights\\' wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long-term issues with Poland. Further [[Polish-Teutonic War (1431–1435)|sporadic warfare]] broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.\\n\\nCracks in the cooperation between Poland and Lithuania after the death of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother [[Švitrigaila]] as grand duke of Lithuania,&lt;ref name=&quot;sruogien&quot;/&gt; but when Švitrigaila, with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus\\' nobles,&lt;ref name=plokhy-98/&gt; rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Oleśnicki]] of Kraków, occupied [[Podolia]], which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and [[Volhynia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stone-11&quot;/&gt; In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas\\'s brother [[Sigismund Kestutaitis|Žygimantas]] as grand duke,&lt;ref name=&quot;sruogien&quot;/&gt; leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław\\'s death.&lt;ref name=plokhy-98/&gt;&lt;ref name=stone-11/&gt;\\n\\n===Succession and death===\\n[[File:Jagiełło sarcophagus figure.jpg|thumb|right|Jagiełło\\'s sarcophagus, [[Wawel Cathedral]]]]\\nWładysław\\'s second wife, Anna of Celje, had died in 1416, leaving a daughter, [[Jadwiga of Lithuania|Jadwiga]]. In 1417, Władysław married [[Elisabeth of Pilica]], who died in 1420 without bearing him a child, and two years later, [[Sophia of Halshany]] (niece of [[Uliana Olshanska]]), who bore him two surviving sons. The death in 1431 of his daughter Jadwiga, the last heir of Piast blood, released Władysław to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had to sweeten the Polish nobles with concessions to ensure their agreement, since the monarchy was elective.\\n\\nDuring an excursion into [[Przemyśl Land]] in the 48th year of his reign, Władysław caught a cold from which he was unable to recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;prazmowska&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sruogien&quot;/&gt; He finally died in [[Grodek Jagiellonski|Grodek]] in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, [[Wladyslaw III of Poland|Władysław III]], and Lithuania to his younger, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir]], both still minors at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;sedlar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell14&quot;/&gt; The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted.

Information is exchanged by passing messages between the processors.&lt;ref&gt;See references in [[#Introduction|Introduction]].&lt;/ref&gt;\\nThe figure on the right illustrates the difference between distributed and parallel systems. Figure (a) is a schematic view of a typical distributed system; the system is represented as a network topology in which each node is a computer and each line connecting the nodes is a communication link. Figure (b) shows the same distributed system in more detail: each computer has its own local memory, and information can be exchanged only by passing messages from one node to another by using the available communication links. Figure (c) shows a parallel system in which each processor has a direct access to a shared memory.\\n\\nThe situation is further complicated by the traditional uses of the terms parallel and distributed ''algorithm'' that do not quite match the above definitions of parallel and distributed ''systems'' (see [[#Theoretical foundations|below]] for more detailed discussion). Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, high-performance parallel computation in a shared-memory multiprocessor uses parallel algorithms while the coordination of a large-scale distributed system uses distributed algorithms.&lt;ref name=&quot;BetalebParallel16&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rahul/allfiles/cs6234-16-pds.pdf |title=Parallel and Distributed Algorithms |author=Bentaleb, A. |author2=Yifan, L. |author3=Xin, J.|display-authors=et al |publisher=National University of Singapore |year=2016 |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n==History==\\nThe use of concurrent processes that communicate by message-passing has its roots in [[operating system]] architectures studied in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; The first widespread distributed systems were [[local-area networks]] such as [[Ethernet]], which was invented in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n[[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the [[Internet]], was introduced in the late 1960s, and ARPANET [[e-mail]] was invented in the early 1970s.

Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.\\n\\nTheoretical computer science seeks to understand which computational problems can be solved by using a computer ([[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]]) and how efficiently ([[computational complexity theory]]). Traditionally, it is said that a problem can be solved by using a computer if we can design an [[algorithm]] that produces a correct solution for any given instance. Such an algorithm can be implemented as a [[computer program]] that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from [[Information|input]], performs some computation, and produces the solution as [[output (computing)|output]].

However, it is not at all obvious what is meant by &quot;solving a problem&quot; in the case of a concurrent or distributed system: for example, what is the task of the algorithm designer, and what is the concurrent or distributed equivalent of a sequential general-purpose computer?{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\\n\\nThe discussion below focuses on the case of multiple computers, although many of the issues are the same for concurrent processes running on a single computer.\\n\\nThree viewpoints are commonly used:\\n; Parallel algorithms in shared-memory model\\n* All processors have access to a shared memory. The algorithm designer chooses the program executed by each processor.\\n* One theoretical model is the [[parallel random access machine]]s (PRAM) that are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|1990}}, Section 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the classical PRAM model assumes synchronous access to the shared memory.\\n* Shared-memory programs can be extended to distributed systems if the underlying operating system encapsulates the communication between nodes and virtually unifies the memory across all individual systems.\\n* A model that is closer to the behavior of real-world multiprocessor machines and takes into account the use of machine instructions, such as [[Compare-and-swap]] (CAS), is that of ''asynchronous shared memory''. There is a wide body of work on this model, a summary of which can be found in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Herlihy|Shavit|2008}}, Chapters 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n; Parallel algorithms in message-passing model\\n* The algorithm designer chooses the structure of the network, as well as the program executed by each computer.\\n* Models such as [[Boolean circuits]] and [[sorting network]]s are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|1990}}, Sections 28 and 29.&lt;/ref&gt; A Boolean circuit can be seen as a computer network: each gate is a computer that runs an extremely simple computer program. Similarly, a sorting network can be seen as a computer network: each comparator is a computer.\\n; Distributed algorithms in message-passing model\\n* The algorithm designer only chooses the computer program. All computers run the same program. The system must work correctly regardless of the structure of the network.\\n* A commonly used model is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with one [[finite-state machine]] per node.\\n\\nIn the case of distributed algorithms, computational problems are typically related to graphs. Often the graph that describes the structure of the computer network ''is'' the problem instance. This is illustrated in the following example.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\\n\\n===An example===\\nConsider the computational problem of finding a coloring of a given graph ''G''. Different fields might take the following approaches:\\n; Centralized algorithms{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\\n* The graph ''G'' is encoded as a string, and the string is given as input to a computer. The computer program finds a coloring of the graph, encodes the coloring as a string, and outputs the result.\\n; Parallel algorithms\\n* Again, the graph ''G'' is encoded as a string. However, multiple computers can access the same string in parallel. Each computer might focus on one part of the graph and produce a coloring for that part.\\n* The main focus is on high-performance computation that exploits the processing power of multiple computers in parallel.\\n; Distributed algorithms\\n* The graph ''G'' is the structure of the computer network. There is one computer for each node of ''G'' and one communication link for each edge of ''G''. Initially, each computer only knows about its immediate neighbors in the graph ''G''; the computers must exchange messages with each other to discover more about the structure of ''G''. Each computer must produce its own color as output.\\n* The main focus is on coordinating the operation of an arbitrary distributed system.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\\n\\nWhile the field of parallel algorithms has a different focus than the field of distributed algorithms, there is a lot of interaction between the two fields. For example, the [[Cole–Vishkin algorithm]] for graph coloring&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cole|Vishkin|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|1990}}, Section 30.5.&lt;/ref&gt; was originally presented as a parallel algorithm, but the same technique can also be used directly as a distributed algorithm.\\n\\nMoreover, a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system (using shared memory) or in a distributed system (using message passing).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms (choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems (shared memory vs. message passing).\\n\\n===Complexity measures===\\nIn parallel algorithms, yet another resource in addition to time and space is the number of computers. Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers running in parallel (see [[speedup]]). If a decision problem can be solved in [[polylogarithmic time]] by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class [[NC (complexity)|NC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Arora|Barak|2009}}, Section 6.7. {{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Section 15.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits—PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Section 15.2.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nIn the analysis of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. This model is commonly known as the LOCAL model. During each ''communication round'', all nodes in parallel (1)&amp;nbsp;receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2)&amp;nbsp;perform arbitrary local computation, and (3)&amp;nbsp;send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure is the number of synchronous communication rounds required to complete the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nThis complexity measure is closely related to the [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] of the network. Let ''D'' be the diameter of the network. On the one hand, any computable problem can be solved trivially in a synchronous distributed system in approximately 2''D'' communication rounds: simply gather all information in one location (''D'' rounds), solve the problem, and inform each node about the solution (''D'' rounds).\\n\\nOn the other hand, if the running time of the algorithm is much smaller than ''D'' communication rounds, then the nodes in the network must produce their output without having the possibility to obtain information about distant parts of the network. In other words, the nodes must make globally consistent decisions based on information that is available in their ''local D-neighbourhood''. Many distributed algorithms are known with the running time much smaller than ''D'' rounds, and understanding which problems can be solved by such algorithms is one of the central research questions of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, Sections 2.3 and 7. {{harvtxt|Linial|1992}}. {{harvtxt|Naor|Stockmeyer|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically an algorithm which solves a problem in polylogarithmic time in the network size is considered efficient in this model.\\n\\nAnother commonly used measure is the total number of bits transmitted in the network (cf. [[communication complexity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SchneiderTrading11&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dT6nwpXvES4C&amp;pg=PA51 |chapter=Trading Bit, Message, and Time Complexity of Distributed Algorithms |title=Distributed Computing |author=Schneider, J. |author2=Wattenhofer, R. |editor=Peleg, D. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=51–65 |year=2011 |isbn=9783642240997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The features of this concept are typically captured with the CONGEST(B) model, which similarly defined as the LOCAL model but where single messages can only contain B bits.\\n\\n===Other problems===\\nTraditional computational problems take the perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes the question for a while, and then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where we do not want the system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the [[dining philosophers problem]] and other similar [[mutual exclusion]] problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or [[deadlock]]s occur.\\n\\nThere are also fundamental challenges that are unique to distributed computing. The first example is challenges that are related to ''fault-tolerance''. Examples of related problems include [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus problems]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, Sections 5–7. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine fault tolerance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 99–102. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-stabilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nA lot of research is also focused on understanding the ''asynchronous'' nature of distributed systems:\\n* [[Synchronizer (algorithm)|Synchronizers]] can be used to run synchronous algorithms in asynchronous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, Section 16. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, Section 6.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n* [[Logical clock]]s provide a causal [[happened-before]] ordering of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, Section 18. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Sections 6.2–6.3.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n* [[Clock synchronization]] algorithms provide globally consistent physical time stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Section 6.4.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n  \\n=== [[Leader election|Election]] ===\\n''Coordinator election'' (or ''leader election'') is the process of designating a single [[Process (computing)|process]] as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes). Before the task is begun, all network nodes are either unaware which node will serve as the &quot;coordinator&quot; (or leader) of the task, or unable to communicate with the current coordinator. After a coordinator election algorithm has been run, however, each node throughout the network recognizes a particular, unique node as the task coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaloiApache15&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym9uBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |title=Apache ZooKeeper Essentials |author=Haloi, S. |publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd |pages=100–101 |year=2015 |isbn=9781784398323}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nThe network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the &quot;coordinator&quot; state. For that, they need some method in order to break the symmetry among them. For example, if each node has unique and comparable identities, then the nodes can compare their identities, and decide that the node with the highest identity is the coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;HaloiApache15&quot; /&gt;\\n\\nThe definition of this problem is often attributed to LeLann, who formalized it as a method to create a new token in a token [[ring network]] in which the token has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeLann|first=G.|year=1977|title=Distributed systems - toward a formal approach|url=|journal=Information Processing|volume=77|pages=155·160|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nCoordinator election algorithms are designed to be economical in terms of total [[byte]]s transmitted, and time. The algorithm suggested by Gallager, Humblet, and Spira &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1983|title=A Distributed Algorithm for Minimum-Weight Spanning Trees|url=http://www.apposite-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/p66-gallager.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems|volume=5|issue=1|pages=66–77|doi=10.1145/357195.357200|author=[[Robert G. Gallager|R. G. Gallager]], P. A. Humblet, and P. M. Spira}}&lt;/ref&gt; for general undirected graphs has had a strong impact on the design of distributed algorithms in general, and won the [[Dijkstra Prize]] for an influential paper in distributed computing.\\n\\nMany other algorithms were suggested for different kind of network [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, such as undirected rings, unidirectional rings, complete graphs, grids, directed Euler graphs, and others. A general method that decouples the issue of the graph family from the design of the coordinator election algorithm was suggested by Korach, Kutten, and Moran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1990|title=A Modular Technique for the Design of Efficient Distributed Leader Finding Algorithms|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems|volume=12|issue=1|pages=84–101|doi=10.1145/77606.77610|first1=Ephraim|last1=Korach|first2=Shay|last2=Kutten|first3=Shlomo|last3=Moran|authorlink2=Shay Kutten|authorlink3=Shlomo Moran|url=https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~moran/r/PS/kkm.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.7342}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nIn order to perform coordination, distributed systems employ the concept of coordinators. The coordinator election problem is to choose a process from among a group of processes on different processors in a distributed system to act as the central coordinator. Several central coordinator election algorithms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/distributed/distributed.html|title=Distributed Algorithms|last=Hamilton|first=Howard|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n===Properties of distributed systems===\\nSo far the focus has been on ''designing'' a distributed system that solves a given problem. A complementary research problem is ''studying'' the properties of a given distributed system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/10045 |title=Major unsolved problems in distributed systems?|author=|date=|website=cstheory.stackexchange.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theserverside.com/feature/How-big-data-and-distributed-systems-solve-traditional-scalability-problems|title=How big data and distributed systems solve traditional scalability problems|author=|date=|website=theserverside.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nThe [[halting problem]] is an analogous example from the field of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever. The halting problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SvozilIndet11&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep_FCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 |chapter=Indeterminism and Randomness Through Physics |title=Randomness Through Computation: Some Answers, More Questions |author=Svozil, K. |editor=Hector, Z. |publisher=World Scientific |pages=112–3 |year=2011 |isbn=9789814462631}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nHowever, there are many interesting special cases that are decidable. In particular, it is possible to reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines. One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock. This problem is [[PSPACE-complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Section 19.3.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., it is decidable, but it is not likely that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.\\n\\n==See also==\\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\\n* [[AppScale]]\\n* [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]]\\n* [[Code mobility]]\\n* [[Decentralized computing]]\\n* [[Distributed algorithm]]\\n* [[Distributed algorithmic mechanism design]]\\n* [[Distributed cache]]\\n* [[Distributed operating system]]\\n* [[Edsger W.
